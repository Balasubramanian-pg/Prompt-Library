## Produce issue logs with recommended next steps

To create an organized and actionable issue log for your project, the AI will guide you through a structured process. This will help document problems clearly and define the path to resolution. Please be prepared to provide the following key details when prompted:

*   **List of Issues:** A clear description of each problem, bug, or obstacle that has been identified.
*   **Issue Details:** For each issue, provide its current status (e.g., New, In Progress, Blocked) and its priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
*   **Context:** Any relevant background information that would help in recommending a next step (e.g., "This is blocking the development team").
*   **Audience:** The intended recipients of the issue log (e.g., the technical team, project leadership, or stakeholders).
