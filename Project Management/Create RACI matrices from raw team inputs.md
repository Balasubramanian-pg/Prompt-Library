### RACI Matrix

**Prompt Integration:** The JSON prompt below is ready for immediate use. The topic, `Create RACI matrices from raw team inputs`, has been pre-configured. To begin, copy the entire code block and submit it to the AI.

**Required Inputs:** During the interactive session, the AI will request your raw project information to build the matrix. To ensure the best results, please be prepared to provide the following details when prompted:

*   **Unstructured Data:** This includes meeting notes, project briefs, or general descriptions of the project's scope.
*   **Task & Deliverable Lists:** A breakdown of the key activities and outcomes required for the project.
*   **Team Roster:** The names of all relevant team members and/or their official roles (e.g., Project Manager, Lead Developer).

By providing this context, you will enable the AI to systematically analyze the inputs and generate a clear, accurate, and actionable RACI matrix tailored to your project's specific needs.
