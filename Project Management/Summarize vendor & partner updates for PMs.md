## Summarize vendor & partner updates for PMs

To create a concise, actionable summary of vendor or partner communications for a Project Manager, the AI will guide you through a structured process. This ensures you get the critical information you need without wading through noise. Please be prepared to provide the following:

*   **The Raw Update:** The complete email, meeting notes, or report you received from the vendor or partner.
*   **Key PM Concerns:** The primary areas you are concerned about for this project (e.g., timeline impacts, budget changes, technical blockers).
*   **Project Context:** A brief note on which project this update relates to, which helps the AI focus its summary on relevant impacts.
*   **Audience:** Who will see this summary besides you (e.g., your team, leadership), which helps tailor the tone.
