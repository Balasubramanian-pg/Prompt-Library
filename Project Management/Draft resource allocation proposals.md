### Draft resource allocation proposals

To draft a compelling and well-justified resource allocation proposal, the AI will guide you through a series of questions to capture the necessary information. Please be prepared to provide the following key details when prompted:

*   **Specific Resource Needs:** A detailed list of the resources you are requesting (e.g., number of full-time employees, specific roles/skills, budget amount, required equipment or software).
*   **Project Context:** A clear description of the project or initiative that these resources will support.
*   **Business Justification:** The core reason for the request, explaining the value it will deliver, the problem it will solve, or the opportunity it will capture.
*   **Impact Analysis:** An assessment of the positive outcomes if the resources are granted, and the negative consequences or risks if they are not.
*   **Timeline:** The duration for which the resources are needed.
