### Draft status update emails for clients

To draft a clear, professional, and effective status update email for your clients, the AI will guide you through a structured process. Please be prepared to provide the following key details when prompted:

*   **Overall Project Status:** A high-level summary of the project's health (e.g., on track, at risk, completed).
*   **Recent Accomplishments:** A list of key tasks or milestones completed since the last update.
*   **Upcoming Activities:** The primary focus and next steps for the upcoming period.
*   **Client Action Items:** Any specific feedback, approvals, or information you require from the client to maintain momentum.
*   **Recipient Information:** The role of the person receiving the email (e.g., primary contact, executive) to ensure the tone and level of detail are appropriate.
