## Summarize kickoff meeting notes into action items

To accurately transform your kickoff meeting notes into a clear, actionable task list, the AI will guide you through a structured process. Please be prepared to provide the following essential information when prompted:

*   **Raw Meeting Notes:** The complete, unedited notes from your meeting. You can copy and paste the entire text, including discussion points and decisions.
*   **List of Attendees:** The names and/or roles of the people present in the meeting. This is crucial for correctly assigning owners to the action items.
*   **Audience for the List:** The intended recipients of the action item summary (e.g., the internal project team, senior stakeholders).
