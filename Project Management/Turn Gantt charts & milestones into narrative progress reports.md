## Turn Gantt charts & milestones into narrative progress reports

To transform your Gantt chart data into a clear and compelling narrative progress report, the AI will guide you through a structured process. Please be prepared to provide the following key details:

*   **Milestone & Task Data:** A list of your key project milestones or tasks, including their planned start/end dates and their current status (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Complete).
*   **Reporting Period:** The timeframe this report should cover (e.g., the last two weeks, the month of May).
*   **Overall Project Health:** A quick summary of how the project is doing (e.g., on track, behind schedule, facing risks).
*   **Audience:** The intended readers of the report (e.g., senior leadership, clients, the internal team).
