## Draft executive slide narratives for steering committee updates

To create a compelling and effective narrative for your steering committee presentation, the AI will guide you through a series of questions. Be prepared to provide the following key details when prompted:

*   **Slide Outline:** A simple list of your slide titles or the key topic for each slide (e.g., "Executive Summary," "Milestone Progress," "Financials," "Risks & Mitigation," "The Ask").
*   **Core Message:** The single most important takeaway you want the committee to have for each slide.
*   **The "Ask":** The specific decision, approval, or action you need from the committee by the end of the meeting.
*   **Audience Context:** A brief description of the steering committee members and what they care about most (e.g., budget, timeline, strategic alignment).
