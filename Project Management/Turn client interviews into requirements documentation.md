## Turn client interviews into requirements documentation

To effectively translate your raw client interview notes into a structured and clear requirements document, the AI will guide you through a collaborative process. Please be prepared to provide the following key information when prompted:

*   **Interview Notes/Transcripts:** The complete, unedited text from your conversations with the client. The more detail you provide, the more accurate the resulting requirements will be.
*   **Project Context:** A brief overview of the project's high-level goal or the problem you are trying to solve.
*   **Desired Format:** The specific format you need for the requirements (e.g., user stories, formal "shall" statements, feature lists).
*   **Audience:** The primary readers of the final document (e.g., developers, QA testers, business stakeholders), as this will determine the necessary level of detail and technicality.
