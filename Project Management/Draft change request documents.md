### Change Request

**Prompt Integration:** The JSON prompt below is ready for immediate use. The topic, `Draft change request documents`, has been pre-configured. To begin, copy the entire code block and submit it to the AI.

**Required Inputs:** During the interactive session, the AI will request the core details of the proposed change. To ensure the document is comprehensive and persuasive, please be prepared to provide the following information when prompted:

*   **Change Description:** A clear and concise explanation of what you are proposing to change.
*   **Justification:** The business case or reason why this change is necessary (e.g., fixing a defect, adding value, responding to a market shift).
*   **Impact Analysis:** Your initial assessment of how the change will affect the project's scope, timeline, budget, and resources.
*   **Audience:** The person or group who will be approving the request (e.g., Change Control Board, project sponsor, client).
