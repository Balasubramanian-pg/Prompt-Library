## Status Report

**Prompt Integration:** The JSON prompt below is ready for immediate use. The topic, `Create recurring status report templates`, has been pre-configured. To begin, copy the entire code block and submit it to the AI.

**Required Inputs:** During the interactive session, the AI will request specific details about the report's purpose and content. To ensure the template is effective and reusable, please be prepared to provide the following information when prompted:

*   **Reporting Audience:** The primary recipients of the report (e.g., senior leadership, clients, the internal project team).
*   **Reporting Frequency:** The interval at which the report will be sent (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, monthly).
*   **Essential Sections:** The key categories of information that must be included in every report (e.g., accomplishments, risks, next steps).
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Any specific metrics that need to be tracked consistently (e.g., budget variance, schedule adherence, user engagement).
