## Summarize post-mortem findings into improvement suggestions

To effectively translate the findings from your project post-mortem into a clear and actionable list of improvement suggestions, the AI will guide you through a structured process. Please be prepared to provide the following key information when prompted:

*   **Post-Mortem Findings:** The raw notes or summary from your post-mortem meeting. This should ideally include details on what went wrong, the root causes, and any initial ideas discussed.
*   **Project/Incident Context:** A brief description of the project or incident that the post-mortem was about.
*   **Audience:** The intended recipients of the suggestions (e.g., the direct team, department heads, an engineering-wide group), as this will influence the framing of the recommendations.
*   **Desired Outcome:** The ultimate goal for these suggestions (e.g., to create tickets in a tracking system, to update a formal process document).
