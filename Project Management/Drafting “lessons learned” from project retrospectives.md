## Drafting “lessons learned” from project retrospectives

To transform the raw feedback from your project retrospective into a structured and actionable "lessons learned" document, the AI will guide you through a collaborative process. Please be prepared to provide the following key inputs when prompted:

*   **Raw Retrospective Notes:** The core output from your meeting. This should ideally be categorized into what went well, what didn't go well, and ideas for improvement.
*   **Actionable Commitments:** Any specific, agreed-upon action items that the team committed to during the retrospective.
*   **Project Context:** A brief overview of the project or sprint being reviewed to provide context for the lessons.
*   **Audience:** The intended recipients of the document (e.g., the immediate team, management, or a wider organizational audience).
