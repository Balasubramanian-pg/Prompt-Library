## Summarize lessons learned from past projects

To effectively synthesize the valuable insights from multiple past projects into a cohesive and actionable summary, the AI will guide you through a structured process. Please be prepared to provide the following key information when prompted:

*   **Source Materials:** The raw "lessons learned" documents, project retrospective notes, or close-out reports from the various projects you wish to analyze.
*   **Key Themes (Optional):** If you have already identified any recurring patterns or themes (e.g., "communication challenges," "success with specific tools"), please share them.
*   **Audience:** The intended recipients of the summary (e.g., project management office, new team members, senior leadership), as this will shape the focus and tone.
*   **Desired Outcome:** The ultimate purpose of the summary (e.g., to create a best practices guide, to inform process changes).
