## Generate project dashboards explanations

To generate a clear and insightful explanation of your project dashboard, the AI will guide you through a structured process. This will transform raw data points into a meaningful narrative for your stakeholders. Please be prepared to provide the following key details when prompted:

*   **Dashboard Components:** A list of the key metrics, charts, or widgets on your dashboard (e.g., "Budget vs. Actual," "Task Burn-down Chart," "Risk Register Summary").
*   **Current Data:** The specific, current data points for each component that you need to explain (e.g., "15% over budget," "80% of tasks completed," "3 high-impact risks").
*   **Target Audience:** The group for whom you are writing the explanation (e.g., executives, clients, the project team), as this will determine the tone and level of detail.
*   **Overall Message:** The main story the dashboard is tellingâ€”whether the project is on track, facing challenges, or exceeding expectations.
