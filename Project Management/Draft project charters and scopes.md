## Draft project charters and scopes

To effectively draft a comprehensive project charter and scope document, the AI will guide you through a structured process to gather the essential project details. Please be prepared to provide the following information when prompted:

*   **Project Vision & Goals:** The high-level purpose of the project and the specific, measurable objectives it aims to achieve.
*   **Key Deliverables:** The main tangible outcomes or products that the project will produce.
*   **Scope Boundaries:** A clear definition of what is considered "in-scope" (work to be done) and, just as importantly, what is "out-of-scope" (work that will not be done).
*   **Key Stakeholders:** The primary individuals involved, such as the project sponsor, project manager, and key team members.
*   **High-Level Assumptions & Constraints:** Any known limitations (like budget or deadlines) and assumptions being made at the project's outset.
