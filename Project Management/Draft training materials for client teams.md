## Draft training materials for client teams

To create effective and easy-to-understand training materials for your clients, the AI will guide you through a collaborative process. Please be prepared to provide the following essential information when prompted:

*   **Learning Objectives:** The specific skills or knowledge the client team should have after completing the training (e.g., "Users will be able to set up their account and create their first campaign").
*   **Target Audience:** A description of the learners, including their role and expected technical proficiency (e.g., "non-technical marketing managers," "experienced system administrators").
*   **Core Content:** The key topics, features, or process steps that must be covered in the training.
*   **Desired Format:** The type of training material you need (e.g., a presentation slide deck, a step-by-step written guide, a video script, a one-page quick-start sheet).
