## Generate risk registers and mitigation suggestions

To build a comprehensive and actionable risk register for your project, the AI will guide you through a structured process to identify and analyze potential threats. Please be prepared to provide the following key details when prompted:

*   **List of Potential Risks:** A brain-dump or list of any potential problems, threats, or uncertainties you foresee for the project.
*   **Project Context:** A brief description of the project's goals and scope, which will help in generating relevant mitigation strategies.
*   **Impact & Likelihood Assessment (Optional):** If you have an initial sense of the potential impact (High, Medium, Low) and likelihood of each risk, please provide it. If not, the AI can help you assess them.
*   **Audience:** The intended recipients of the risk register (e.g., project team, senior leadership), as this will determine the level of detail.
