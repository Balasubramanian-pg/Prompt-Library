## Generate first-pass budget tracking notes

To generate a clear and accurate first-pass budget tracking note, the AI will guide you through a structured process to gather your financial data. Please be prepared to provide the following essential details when prompted:

*   **Total Budget:** The overall approved budget for the project or period.
*   **List of Expenses:** A raw list of all expenditures to date. For each expense, please provide a description and the amount.
*   **Expense Categories (Optional but Recommended):** Grouping expenses by category (e.g., "Software," "Marketing," "Personnel") will allow for a more insightful summary.
*   **Reporting Period:** The specific timeframe that this budget note should cover (e.g., the current month, the entire project to date).
