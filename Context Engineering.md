## **Context Engineering 101**

Context engineering is the practice of **designing prompts with layered detail** so Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot generate consistent, high-quality outputs. Instead of a single vague query, you build prompts that gradually add information and constraints—almost like scaffolding.

**Why it matters:**

* Reduces ambiguity → more accurate responses
* Standardizes outputs across teams → consistency in tone, style, and depth
* Saves time → fewer revisions, faster usable results

**How it works:**

1. **Start broad** – Define the task in plain language (“Write a follow-up email”).
2. **Add layers** – Provide context: audience, tone, length, purpose.
3. **Incremental complexity** – Move from simple prompts → structured templates → reusable families.
4. **Feedback loop** – Refine prompts based on results and team input.

**Example:**

* Level 1: “Write a follow-up email after a meeting.”
* Level 2: “Write a professional follow-up email for a client meeting, highlighting next steps and attaching the proposal.”
* Level 3: “Draft 3 variations of a professional follow-up email for a client meeting, each with a different tone (formal, collaborative, persuasive), highlighting next steps, attaching the proposal, and closing with a clear call-to-action.”

**End Goal:**
An enterprise prompt library that’s **context-rich, layered, and standardized**, so employees across verticals get reliable outputs every time.
