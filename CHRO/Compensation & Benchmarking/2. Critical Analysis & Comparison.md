      "3. **Data Discrepancy Analysis:** Compare the compensation ranges (base, total comp, etc.) across all sources. Explicitly point out any significant inconsistencies or outliers. For example, 'Levels.fyi's total compensation range is significantly higher than Glassdoor's estimate.'",
      "4. **Explanation of Discrepancies:** Synthesize the findings from the previous steps to provide hypotheses for the observed differences. Explain *why* the data might differ (e.g., 'The discrepancy is likely due to Levels.fyi's focus on top-tier tech companies, which offer higher equity components, while Glassdoor captures a broader market including non-tech industries.').",
      "5. **Contextualize the Data:** Based on the `query_details.location`, provide relevant external factors that influence compensation but aren't in the raw data (e.g., 'Austin, TX is a major tech hub with a high cost of living and intense competition for talent, which drives salaries up, particularly in the tech sector.').",
      "6. **Conclusion:** Summarize the analysis. State which data sources appear most reliable for the specific query and why. Provide a high-level qualitative overview of the market (e.g., 'The market for this role is robust, with a wide compensation band heavily influenced by company tier and equity offerings.'). Crucially, end by stating that this analysis is a precursor to determining a final range."

    "output": "# Compensation Data: Critical Analysis\n\n**Query:** Senior Senior Product Manager in Austin, TX\n\n---\n\n### Source Reliability Assessment\n\n*   **Levels.fyi:** This source is highly reliable for its target demographic: employees at top-tier tech companies. The sample size of 150 is robust, and the breakdown of compensation components is detailed. However, its primary bias is an upward skew, as it underrepresents smaller companies, non-tech industries, and startups with less cash compensation.\n*   **Glassdoor:** This source offers a broader market view but is generally less reliable for specific, high-demand roles. The sample size of 88 is decent, but the data is aggregated and lacks a clear breakdown of equity. Its 'Total Pay' estimate appears low and may not accurately capture the RSU components prevalent in tech.\n\n### Data Discrepancy Analysis\n\nThe most significant discrepancy is in the Total Compensation. Levels.fyi reports a range of $195k - $320k, while Glassdoor provides a single estimate of $168k. The base salary ranges are more closely aligned, but Levels.fyi's top end is still ~$15k higher. Glassdoor completely omits equity, which is a critical component of tech compensation and the primary driver of the total compensation gap.\n\n### Explanation of Discrepancies\n\nThe gap is almost entirely explained by the different populations being surveyed. Levels.fyi's data is dominated by employees from companies like Google, Meta, and Apple, where substantial equity grants are standard for senior roles. Glassdoor's data includes a wider array of companies in Austin, including non-tech firms and smaller businesses where compensation is more cash-based and equity is less common or valuable, thus pulling the overall average down.\n\n### External Context\n\nAustin, TX is a major secondary tech hub with a significant presence from major tech employers. This creates a highly competitive talent market, driving up compensation, especially for experienced product roles. The cost of living, while lower than Silicon Valley, has risen sharply, putting further upward pressure on cash salaries. Therefore, high total compensation packages, rich in equity, are expected for senior roles in this market.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor a Senior Product Manager role in the Austin tech scene, Levels.fyi provides a more realistic, albeit optimistic, picture of the potential total compensation. Glassdoor's data is more indicative of the broader market, including non-tech industries, and serves as a conservative floor for the base salary. The most reliable data points to a market where equity is a major differentiator, and total compensation can vary dramatically based on the employer's size and sector."
