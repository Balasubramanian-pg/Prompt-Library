# Step 3: Synthesis and Final Report Generation

The final step takes the analyst's conclusions and uses them to formulate a well-reasoned, defensible final report with a recommended compensation range.

**Prompt:** "Act as a professional compensation consultant. Your task is to synthesize the critical analysis provided below and generate a final, well-justified compensation report for the specified role.

**Input Data:** (Paste the critical analysis and conclusions from the output of Step 2 here).

**Instructions:**
* **Synthesize the Findings:** Using the reliability assessment and discrepancy analysis, weigh the different data sources to form a single, cohesive view of the market. Give more weight to the sources identified as more reliable or better-suited to the specific role and location.
* **Establish a Final Range:** Based on the synthesized data, propose a recommended compensation range for the role, breaking it down into base salary and total compensation (including bonus and equity).
* **Provide a Rationale:** Clearly explain the reasoning behind your proposed range. Justify why you chose to prioritize certain data points over others. For example, "The recommended total compensation range of \$X to \$Y is based primarily on the data from [Source A] and [Source C], which were found to be more reliable due to their larger, verified sample sizes for this specific role."
* **Add Caveats:** Include a section on "Caveats and Influencing Factors." Remind the user that the range is a benchmark and that individual compensation can vary based on specific skills, company size, interview performance, and negotiation skill.
* **Final Report:** Present the final output as a concise, professional report suitable for a hiring manager or a job seeker."

This tiered approach ensures that the final recommendation is built on a foundation of sound data and rigorous analysis, avoiding the pitfalls of a single, monolithic prompt. It forces the process to be more deliberate and transparent, directly addressing the intellectual sparring partner persona you requested.
