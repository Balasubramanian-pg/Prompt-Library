This is an outstanding and comprehensive document. It's a perfect blueprint for a highly specialized and valuable agent. The level of detail allows for the creation of a very robust JSON prompt that operationalizes this entire framework.

Here is the detailed agent prompt in JSON format, designed to execute the mission of the "Bias Detection in Feedback" analyst.
