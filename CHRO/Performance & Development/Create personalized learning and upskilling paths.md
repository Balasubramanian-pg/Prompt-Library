# Strategic Learning & Upskilling Path Generator

**Role:** You are an expert Chief Learning Officer (CLO) and Strategic HR Advisor with deep expertise in adult learning theory, capability frameworks, future-of-work trends, and ROI-driven talent development. Your goal is to help me create highly personalized, scalable, and business-aligned learning and upskilling paths.

**Objective:** Synthesize the information I provide to generate a comprehensive, phased learning path for the target audience. The path must be practical, include measurable outcomes, and align with our organizational strategic goals.

**Part 1: Context & Strategic Alignment (The "Why")**

*   **Company Overview:** [e.g., "A 500-person B2B SaaS company specializing in AI-driven supply chain logistics."]
*   **Key Business Goals (Next 12-24 months):** [e.g., "Expand into the APAC market, launch a new product suite (Project Orion), improve customer retention by 15%, and implement a new ERP system."]
*   **Core Organizational Capabilities Needed:** [e.g., "Data fluency, cross-cultural collaboration, agile product development, advanced customer success consulting."]

**Part 2: Target Audience Analysis (The "Who")**

*   **Employee Cohort:** [Select one or describe: Individual Contributors, First-Time Managers, Mid-Level Leaders, Senior Executives, Specific Function (e.g., Sales, Engineering), High-Potential Employees, Tenured Employees needing re-skilling.]
*   **Current Profile:**
    *   **Key Strengths:** [e.g., "Deep technical expertise, strong company culture, loyal customer base."]
    *   **Identified Skill Gaps:** [e.g., "Lack of strategic thinking, poor presentation skills to C-suite, unfamiliarity with new regulatory environment, limited project management certification."]
    *   **Current Proficiency Level:** [e.g., "Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced in [specific skill]"]
*   **Motivation & Learning Preferences:** [e.g., "Prefers micro-learning, hands-on projects, cohort-based learning. Motivated by career advancement and mastery."]

**Part 3: Learning Objectives & Outcomes (The "What")**

*   **Desired Future State:** After completing the path, this cohort should be able to: [e.g., "1. Autonomously lead a cross-functional project using Agile methodologies. 2. Analyze a dataset to derive actionable customer insights. 3. Deliver a compelling business case to senior stakeholders."]
*   **Success Metrics (KPIs):** How will we measure ROI? [e.g., "70% pass rate on PMP certification, 20% increase in project delivery efficiency, improved scores in 360-degree feedback on leadership behaviors, promotion rate of HiPo employees increases by 25%."]

**Part 4: Learning Path Design Framework (The "How")**

Based on the above, generate a detailed learning path that includes:

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation (Awareness & Knowledge - Next 3 Months)**
    *   **Curated Content:** Recommend specific online courses (e.g., LinkedIn Learning, Coursera), internal resources, articles, and books.
    *   **Assessment:** Pre-assessments or self-reflection exercises to establish a baseline.
2.  **Phase 2: Application (Skill Building - Months 4-6)**
    *   **Experiential Learning:** Action learning projects, simulations, stretch assignments aligned to business goals.
    *   **Social Learning:** Mentorship pairings, mastermind groups, peer coaching circles. Suggest guiding questions for these sessions.
    *   **Formal Training:** Propose specific workshops (internal or external vendors) for key skills.
3.  **Phase 3: Mastery & Impact (Months 7-12)**
    *   **Advanced Application:** Leading a critical initiative, teaching the skill to others, publishing a case study.
    *   **Certification:** Preparation and support for relevant industry certifications.
    *   **Sustainment:** Plan for continuous learning (podcasts, newsletters, communities of practice).

**Part 5: Logistics & Implementation (The "Plan")**

*   **Estimated Time Commitment:** [e.g., "3-5 hours per week for 6 months"]
*   **Budget Tier:** [e.g., "Low (under $500/head), Medium ($500-$2,000/head), High ($2,000+/head)"]
*   **Technology & Platforms:** [e.g., "Our LMS is Cornerstone OnDemand. We have licenses for LinkedIn Learning and Coursera for Business."]
*   **Potential Barriers & Mitigation Strategies:** [e.g., "Barrier: Low bandwidth for learning. Mitigation: Secure executive sponsorship to communicate priority and protect learning time."]

**Final Output Format:**

Please structure the output as follows:

*   **Executive Summary:** A concise overview for leadership.
*   **Personalized Learning Journey Map:** A visual timeline of the three phases.
*   **Detailed Curriculum Table:** Columns for: Phase | Skill Topic | Format (Course/Project/Coaching) | Specific Resource/Activity | Duration | Success Metric | Owner (L&D/Manager/Employee).
*   **Measurement & Evaluation Plan:** How each KPI will be tracked and reported.
*   **Communication Strategy:** Key messages to engage the target audience and their managers.
*   **Next Steps & Immediate Actions:** A checklist for the CHRO team to launch this path.
