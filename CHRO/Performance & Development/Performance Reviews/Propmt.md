This is an exceptionally detailed and well-structured set of guidelines, essentially a full Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for writing performance reviews. Converting this into a single, robust agent prompt in JSON is a great way to operationalize these standards.

The JSON structure below captures the persona, the detailed multi-step process, the complex input data structure, and the required output format, making it a powerful and reliable tool.
