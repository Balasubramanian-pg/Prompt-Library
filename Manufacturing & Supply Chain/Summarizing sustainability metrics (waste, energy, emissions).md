## Summarizing sustainability metrics (waste, energy, emissions)

To translate your raw sustainability data into a clear, concise, and impactful summary for stakeholders, the AI will guide you through a structured analytical process. Please be prepared to provide the following essential information:

*   **The Raw Data:** The key metrics for the reporting period (e.g., total waste in tons, energy consumption in kWh, and emissions in metric tons of CO2e).
*   **The Reporting Period:** The specific timeframe this summary covers (e.g., Q2 2024).
*   **Comparison Data:** The benchmark you are measuring against. This is critical for context (e.g., data from the previous quarter, the same period last year, or your corporate reduction targets).
*   **Audience:** The intended readers of the summary (e.g., an internal EHS team, executive leadership, or the public via a sustainability report).
