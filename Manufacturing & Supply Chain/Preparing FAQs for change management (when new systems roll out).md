## Preparing FAQs for change management (when new systems roll out)

To create a clear, empathetic, and comprehensive FAQ document that addresses employee concerns and supports a smooth transition to a new system, the AI will guide you through a collaborative process. Please be prepared to provide the following essential information:

*   **The New System:** A clear description of the new system, its name, and its primary purpose.
*   **The Change for Users:** What specific daily tasks or workflows will be different for the employees using the new system?
*   **The "Why":** The core business reason for the change. Explaining the benefits helps build buy-in.
*   **Target Audience:** The specific group(s) of employees the FAQ is for (e.g., sales team, finance department, warehouse staff) and their anticipated anxieties or questions.
*   **Key Logistics:** Important dates (training sessions, go-live date) and the designated support channels for help.
