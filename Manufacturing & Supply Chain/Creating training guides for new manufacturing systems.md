# Creating training guides for new manufacturing systems

To develop a clear, safe, and effective training guide for your new manufacturing system, the AI will guide you through a collaborative process. Please be prepared to provide the following critical information when prompted:

*   **The System Itself:** What is the new system, machine, or software? What is its primary function on the manufacturing floor?
*   **The Audience:** Who are you training? (e.g., new machine operators, experienced maintenance technicians, line supervisors). Their role and skill level are crucial.
*   **Critical Tasks & Procedures:** The specific, step-by-step actions the user must learn, including startup, shutdown, operation, and routine checks.
*   **Safety Protocols:** Any and all mandatory safety warnings, procedures, and personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements associated with the system.
*   **Desired Format:** The type of guide you need (e.g., a detailed manual, a laminated quick-reference card, an instructor's script).
