## Summarizing ERP or MES data dumps into exec-level insights

To translate a raw, complex data dump from your ERP or MES system into a concise and meaningful summary for leadership, the AI will guide you through a structured analytical process. Please be prepared to provide the following:

*   **The Data Sample:** A representative sample of the data dump. You can paste it in a delimited format (like CSV) or simply describe the key columns and a few rows of data.
*   **The Business Question:** The most important question you or your leadership are trying to answer with this data (e.g., "Where are our biggest production inefficiencies?" or "What is driving our material cost variance?").
*   **Key Metrics (KPIs):** The specific performance indicators that matter to your executives (e.g., OEE, scrap rate, cost per unit, on-time delivery).
*   **Audience:** The specific executive you are reporting to (e.g., COO, CFO), as their priorities will shape the narrative.
