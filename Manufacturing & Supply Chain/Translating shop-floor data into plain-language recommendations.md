## Translating shop-floor data into plain-language recommendations

To effectively translate technical shop-floor data into a clear, concise, and actionable summary for a non-technical audience, the AI will guide you through a structured analytical process. Please be prepared to provide the following key inputs:

*   **The Raw Data:** The specific shop-floor metrics you need to explain (e.g., OEE percentages, scrap rates, downtime reason codes, production counts vs. target).
*   **The Business Context:** A brief explanation of the situation. Why is this analysis being done? (e.g., "We missed our production target," "We are evaluating a new process").
*   **The Audience:** The person or group who needs to understand this information (e.g., a plant manager, a finance director, an executive team).
*   **The Key Message:** The main story the data is telling (e.g., "Machine #5 is our primary bottleneck," "The night shift is outperforming the day shift").
