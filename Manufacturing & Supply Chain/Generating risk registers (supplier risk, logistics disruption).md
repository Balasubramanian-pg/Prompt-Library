# Generate risk registers (supplier risk, logistics disruption)

To build a robust and actionable risk register focused on your supply chain vulnerabilities, the AI will guide you through a structured process. This will help you systematically identify, assess, and plan for potential disruptions. Please be prepared to provide:

*   **Critical Nodes:** A list of your most critical suppliers (e.g., single-source, high-dependency) and your most vital logistics routes or hubs (e.g., key shipping lanes, ports, distribution centers).
*   **Potential Threats:** The types of disruptions you are concerned about for those critical nodes (e.g., geopolitical events, financial instability of a partner, port congestion, natural disasters).
*   **Impact Assessment:** Your initial thoughts on the potential business impact (High, Medium, Low) and likelihood of these threats occurring.
*   **Audience:** The intended readers of the register (e.g., the supply chain team, executive leadership).
