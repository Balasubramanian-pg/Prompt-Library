## Writing SOPs for plant operations, quality checks, or maintenance

To create a formal, safe, and unambiguous Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) that ensures consistency and quality, the AI will guide you through a structured process. Please be prepared to provide the following critical details when prompted:

*   **The Specific Task:** The exact procedure this SOP is for (e.g., "startup procedure for the CNC machine," "visual inspection of Part #XYZ," "monthly lubrication of the conveyor belt").
*   **The Sequence of Steps:** The core actions, from start to finish, that the user must perform.
*   **Critical Safety Information:** All mandatory safety warnings, required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and any relevant lockout/tagout (LOTO) procedures. This is the most important input.
*   **The User:** The role of the person who will be following this SOP (e.g., a new machine operator, a senior QC inspector, a maintenance technician).
*   **Required Tools and Materials:** A list of all equipment or supplies needed to complete the task correctly.
