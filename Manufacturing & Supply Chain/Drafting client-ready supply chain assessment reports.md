## Drafting client-ready supply chain assessment reports

To translate your raw assessment data and findings into a polished, professional, and client-ready report, the AI will guide you through a structured process. Please be prepared to provide the following key information when prompted:

*   **Assessment Findings:** The core data, observations, and outputs from your supply chain analysis. This should include both strengths and weaknesses you identified.
*   **Assessment Scope:** A clear definition of what parts of the client's supply chain were reviewed (e.g., procurement, logistics, inventory management) and what was out of scope.
*   **Methodology:** A brief summary of how the assessment was conducted (e.g., data analysis, stakeholder interviews, site visits).
*   **Initial Recommendations:** Any high-level ideas you have for improvements based on your findings.
