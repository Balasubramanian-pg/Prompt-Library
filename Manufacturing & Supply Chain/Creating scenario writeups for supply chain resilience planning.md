## Creating scenario writeups for supply chain resilience planning

To develop detailed and plausible scenario writeups that effectively test your supply chain's resilience, the AI will guide you through a structured process. Please be prepared to provide the following key information when prompted:

*   **The Disruptive Event:** The core scenario you want to model (e.g., a major geopolitical conflict, a key supplier bankruptcy, a natural disaster in a critical region, a widespread cyberattack).
*   **Scope and Magnitude:** The scale of the disruption (e.g., affecting a single tier-1 supplier, a major logistics hub, or an entire geographic region).
*   **Focus Area:** The specific part of your supply chain you want to stress-test (e.g., raw material sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, last-mile delivery).
*   **Audience:** The intended users of the writeup (e.g., a crisis management team for a tabletop exercise, senior leadership for strategic planning).
