## Writing standard templates for demand planning reviews

To create a structured, repeatable, and effective template for your demand planning review meetings or reports, the AI will guide you through a collaborative process. This will ensure your template covers all critical elements for achieving a consensus forecast. Please be prepared to provide:

*   **Review Cadence & Horizon:** The frequency of the review (e.g., monthly, weekly) and the time horizon you forecast for (e.g., 18-month rolling).
*   **Key Participants:** The roles typically involved in the review (e.g., demand planners, sales, marketing, finance).
*   **Core Data Points:** The essential metrics you always discuss (e.g., forecast accuracy, statistical baseline, sales pipeline data, promotional uplifts).
*   **Desired Output:** The final format you need (e.g., a meeting agenda, a slide deck outline, a formal report template).
