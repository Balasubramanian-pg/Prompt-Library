## Converting client interviews into structured pain-point summaries

To accurately distill your client interview notes into a clear, thematic summary of their pain points, the AI will guide you through a collaborative process. Please be prepared to provide the following key information when prompted:

*   **Interview Notes/Transcripts:** The complete, raw text from your client conversations. This is the most critical input for identifying genuine pain points.
*   **Key Focus Areas (Optional):** If you are particularly interested in problems related to specific areas (e.g., "onboarding," "reporting," "user interface"), please note them.
*   **Audience:** The intended readers of this summary (e.g., product managers, UX designers, sales team), as this will determine the focus and framing of the pain points.
*   **Desired Format:** The structure you prefer for the final summary (e.g., a themed list, a table with quotes, a narrative).
