## Drafting site-visit reports with action items

To effectively convert your on-the-ground observations into a structured, professional site-visit report with clear, actionable next steps, the AI will guide you through a collaborative process. Please be prepared to provide the following key information when prompted:

*   **Visit Details:** The essential context, including the site visited, the date of the visit, the attendees, and the primary purpose of the visit.
*   **Raw Notes and Observations:** Your complete, unedited notes from the visit. This should include what you saw, who you talked to, key discussion points, and any data or metrics collected.
*   **Key Findings:** A summary of your most important takeaways, both positive observations (strengths) and areas needing improvement (opportunities).
*   **Audience:** The intended recipients of the report (e.g., senior management, the site team, a client), which will shape the report's tone and focus.
