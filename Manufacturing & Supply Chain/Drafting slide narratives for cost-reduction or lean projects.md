## Drafting slide narratives for cost-reduction or lean projects

To build a persuasive and data-driven narrative for your cost-reduction or lean project presentation, the AI will guide you through a structured process. This will help you craft a compelling business case that justifies your proposal or showcases your results. Please be prepared to provide:

*   **Slide Outline:** A list of your slide titles, which should follow a logical flow (e.g., "Problem Statement," "Current State Analysis," "Proposed Solution," "Financial Impact," "Implementation Plan," "The Ask").
*   **Key Data Points:** The critical numbers for each slide (e.g., current waste costs, projected savings, implementation budget, ROI, payback period).
*   **The "Ask":** The specific decision, funding, or approval you are seeking from your audience.
*   **Audience Context:** Who you are presenting to (e.g., CFO, COO, plant management) and what they value most (e.g., hard numbers, operational stability, strategic alignment).
