## Preparing RFP drafts for vendors or 3PLs

To create a comprehensive and effective Request for Proposal (RFP) that will elicit clear, comparable, and high-quality bids from potential partners, the AI will guide you through a structured process. Please be prepared to provide the following essential components:

*   **Company Background:** A brief overview of your company and the context for this RFP.
*   **Scope of Work:** A detailed description of the services or products you are seeking. This is the most critical section.
*   **Key Requirements:** A list of mandatory requirements the vendor must meet, including any technical specifications, service levels (SLAs), or certifications.
*   **Evaluation Criteria:** An outline of how you will score and select the winning proposal (e.g., weighting for cost, technical solution, experience).
*   **Submission Details:** The key dates (especially the submission deadline), contact information, and the required format for proposals.
