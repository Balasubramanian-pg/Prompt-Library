## Drafting communications for plant workforce during transformations

To craft clear, empathetic, and effective communications for your plant workforce during a period of significant change, the AI will guide you through a structured and thoughtful process. Please be prepared to provide the following essential information when prompted:

*   **The Transformation:** A clear description of the change. What is happening? (e.g., introduction of new automation, a change in shift structures, a new production process, a merger/acquisition).
*   **The "Why":** The core business reason for the transformation. This is crucial for building understanding and trust.
*   **Audience Details:** A description of the workforce. What are their primary concerns? What is their current morale?
*   **The Core Message:** The single most important takeaway you need the workforce to understand from this communication.
*   **Communication Channel:** The format you need (e.g., a script for a plant manager's town hall, a formal memo, talking points for supervisors).
