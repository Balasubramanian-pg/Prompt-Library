## Turn raw process maps into narrative workflows

To transform your visual process map (like a flowchart or swimlane diagram) into a clear, step-by-step narrative that anyone can understand, the AI will guide you through a collaborative process. Please be prepared to provide the following essential information:

*   **The Process Steps:** A description of your process map. You can do this by listing the main steps, tasks, and decision points (e.g., "If X, then Y") in their logical sequence.
*   **The Actors:** The key roles, departments, or systems responsible for performing each step in the process.
*   **The Trigger and End Point:** What event starts the process, and what is the final successful outcome?
*   **Audience:** The intended readers of the narrative (e.g., new hires, auditors, non-technical managers).
