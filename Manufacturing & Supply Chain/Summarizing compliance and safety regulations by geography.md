## Summarizing compliance and safety regulations by geography

To distill complex and varied regulatory landscapes into a clear, comparable, and business-focused summary, the AI will guide you through a structured analytical process. Please be prepared to provide the following essential information when prompted:

*   **Geographies of Interest:** The specific countries, states, or regions you need to understand and compare.
*   **Your Industry and Operations:** The context of your business is crucial. Are you in manufacturing, logistics, construction, or another sector? What specific activities will be taking place in these locations?
*   **Key Compliance Areas:** The specific domains of regulation you are concerned about (e.g., worker health and safety, environmental protection, product standards, transportation rules).
*   **Audience:** The intended readers of the summary (e.g., EHS managers, legal counsel, executive leadership), which dictates the required level of detail and focus.
