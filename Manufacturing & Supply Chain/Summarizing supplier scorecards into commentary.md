## Summarizing supplier scorecards into commentary

To translate the quantitative data from a supplier scorecard into a balanced, professional, and actionable narrative, the AI will guide you through a structured process. Please be prepared to provide the following key information:

*   **Scorecard Data:** The specific metrics and their scores from the scorecard (e.g., On-Time Delivery: 98%, Quality/Defect Rate: 0.5%, Cost Variance: +2%).
*   **Supplier Context:** A brief note on who the supplier is and the criticality of the products or services they provide.
*   **Overall Assessment:** Your general feeling about the supplier's performance during this period (e.g., "They are a top performer," "They are struggling with quality," "They are improving but inconsistent").
*   **Audience:** The intended recipient of the commentary (e.g., the supplier for a business review, your internal procurement team, or senior leadership).
