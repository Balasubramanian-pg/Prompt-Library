Hi [Recipient Name],

Hope you're having a good week.

Regarding your project update email from yesterday, May 8th, for the 'Q3 Website Relaunch' project, I had a quick question.

Specifically, concerning the line mentioning 'an unexpected increase in third-party licensing costs,' could you provide a bit more detail on the specific licenses affected and the magnitude of the increase? Also, do we have any immediate alternative vendors or negotiation options being explored?

Understanding this will help me assess the impact on our overall budget and inform discussions with finance. Please let me know your thoughts when you have a moment.

Thanks,

[Your Name]
