  Alignment Check (Internal Consistency):
        Use Case: Verify that different sections of the AOP align with each other and with overall strategic goals.
        Prompt: "Compare the 'Strategic Goals' section with the 'Departmental Objectives for [Department Name]'. Identify any inconsistencies or areas where departmental objectives do not clearly support the overarching strategic goals. Suggest revisions for better alignment."
