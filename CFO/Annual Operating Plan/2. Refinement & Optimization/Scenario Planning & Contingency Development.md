### Prompt Template:

"**[AOP Year/Cycle]** **[Section Name/Focus]** Scenario Planning & Contingency Development:

**Primary Objective:** For our **[Target AOP Year, e.g., 2024]** Annual Operating Plan, generate a comprehensive contingency plan to address the specific "what-if" scenario described below. This plan must detail necessary adjustments across our production schedule, budget, and customer communication strategies.

**I. Input: Specific Scenario & Context (Crucial Input - Be Extremely Detailed):**

   *   **Scenario Description:** **['[Key Supplier Name, e.g., "TechComponent Inc."']** experiences a **[Specific Change 1, e.g., 20% price increase]** on **[Specific Item/Service, e.g., 'critical microprocessors for our "Flagship Product"']** AND a **[Specific Change 2, e.g., 1-month delivery delay]** for all subsequent orders.
   *   **Contextual Information about Key Supplier/Dependency:**
      *   **Supplier's Role:** **[e.g., Sole supplier for a unique, patented component, or primary supplier for a high-volume, cost-sensitive part.]**
      *   **Impact of Their Product/Service:** **[e.g., The microprocessors are essential for 80% of our "Flagship Product" units.]**
      *   **Current Stock/Inventory:** **[e.g., We currently have a 2-week supply of these microprocessors on hand.]**
      *   **Current Lead Time from this Supplier:** **[e.g., Standard lead time is 4 weeks.]**
      *   **Volume/Cost Impact (Current AOP):** **[e.g., TechComponent Inc. accounts for 30% of our total raw material spend for Flagship Product, annual volume is 100,000 units.]**
      *   **Existing Alternative Suppliers (if any):** **[e.g., No immediate alternatives for this patented component, but a secondary supplier (GlobalChip Co.) could produce a less optimized version with 3-month lead time.]**
   *   **Relevant AOP Goals/Commitments Affected:**
      *   **[Relevant Goal 1, e.g., Achieve 20% growth in "Flagship Product" sales.]**
      *   **[Relevant Goal 2, e.g., Maintain 35% gross profit margin on "Flagship Product."]**
      *   **[Relevant Goal 3, e.g., Maintain 98% on-time delivery rate to customers.]**
   *   **Key Dependencies/Bottlenecks for our Production:** **[e.g., Assembly line capacity, specialized labor availability, other component lead times.]**

**II. Contingency Plan Requirements & Output Structure:**

   **For Each Operational Area, Outline Specific Adjustments:**

   **A. Production Schedule Adjustments:**
      *   **Immediate Actions (Days 1-7):** **[e.g., Halt production of "Flagship Product" if existing stock runs out, prioritize production of alternative products not affected by this component, activate alternative component procurement assessment.]**
      *   **Short-Term Adjustments (Weeks 1-4):** **[e.g., Re-allocate production line resources, explore feasibility of using the less optimized component from GlobalChip Co. for a subset of orders, revise production forecasts.]**
      *   **Long-Term Adjustments (Months 1+):** **[e.g., Re-design product to use alternative, more readily available components; accelerate qualification of new suppliers; adjust inventory buffer strategies.]**
      *   **Decision Triggers:** **[What specific metrics or events would trigger which adjustment? e.g., If no confirmation of new delivery date within 3 days, trigger alternative supplier assessment.]**

   **B. Budget Adjustments:**
      *   **Impact Assessment:** **[Quantify the immediate and projected financial impact of the price increase and delay. e.g., $X million increase in COGS per month, $Y million in lost sales due to delays.]**
      *   **Cost Mitigation Strategies:** **[e.g., Absorb initial cost increase, re-negotiate other supplier contracts, implement temporary hiring freeze, reduce non-essential discretionary spending.]**
      *   **Funding Rerouting:** **[Identify specific budget line items that could be reduced or re-prioritized to offset the additional costs. e.g., Reallocate funds from Q4 marketing campaigns, draw from contingency reserve.]**
      *   **Pricing Strategy Adjustments:** **[Consider options for price increases (e.g., surcharge, new pricing tiers) and their potential market impact. e.g., Implement a 5% price increase on new orders of Flagship Product, effective in 2 weeks, with clear communication.]**

   **C. Customer Communication Strategy:**
      *   **Internal Communication Plan:** **[Who needs to know what, and when? e.g., Brief Sales, Customer Service, and Leadership immediately.]**
      *   **External Communication Plan (Tiered Approach):**
         *   **Tier 1 (High-Value/Critical Customers):** **[e.g., Proactive, personalized outreach (phone call/email) from account managers, offering specific alternatives or revised delivery dates with compensation if applicable.]**
         *   **Tier 2 (Standard Customers with Open Orders):** **[e.g., General email communication detailing delay and new estimated delivery windows, with option to contact support.]**
         *   **Tier 3 (General Public/New Orders):** **[e.g., Update website with revised delivery estimates, pause marketing for affected products, adjust sales messaging to manage expectations.]**
      *   **Messaging Framework:** **[Key messages to convey (transparency, commitment to quality, active resolution), what *not* to say, FAQs.]**
      *   **Recovery/Compensation (if applicable):** **[e.g., Offer expedited shipping for delayed orders, discounts on future purchases, extended warranty.]**

   **D. Risk Assessment & Re-evaluation:**
      *   **Secondary Risks Identified:** **[What new risks emerge from implementing this contingency plan? e.g., Customer churn due to delays, brand reputation damage, increased reliance on a new unproven supplier.]**
      *   **Monitoring Metrics:** **[What KPIs will be closely monitored to track the scenario's impact and the effectiveness of mitigation? e.g., On-time delivery rate, customer satisfaction scores, COGS for Flagship Product.]**

**III. Overall Output & Tone Requirements:**
   *   **Desired Tone:** **[e.g., Realistic, Proactive, Action-oriented, Comprehensive, Calm in crisis]**
   *   **Desired Length:** **[e.g., Detailed, multi-paragraph plan suitable for executive review, with clear headings and bullet points.]**
   *   **Formatting:** **[e.g., Use clear headings for each section (Production, Budget, Communication), bullet points for actions, bold key decisions or impacts.]**
   *   **Key Audience:** **[e.g., Executive Leadership Team, Operations Manager, Finance Director, Sales & Marketing Director]**
